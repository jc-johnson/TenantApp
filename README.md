Communication App For Tenants/Landlords

a startup idea shared by  AR on 01/10/2013

Overview: Create convenience/communication features for tenants and landlords/property managers via mobile app

Target: Apartment Rental buildings, Real Estate Management Companies. There are currently similar software but for larger/more sophisticated buildings. I am talking about smaller scale here. 

Use Cases:
A) Report Maintenance Issues
B) Make Complaints/Safety Reminders
C) Bill Pay and Rent Reminder
D) Contracts, Lease Renewal, Lease Terms and Length
E) Package Notifications
F) Utilities
F) Emergency Info.
G) Bulletin Board
H) Visual Laundry (optional and can be a separate app)

Revenue: Offer a freemium model with basic features for free. Add ons could be bill pay, cloud storage, laundry app, etc. Advertisement could come from local businesses and upgrade version. Could also allow local business to push deals/coupons within a certain geographic area
